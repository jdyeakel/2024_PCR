## Abstract
Body size drives the energetic demands of organisms, and largely governs trophic interactions between species. On macroevolutionary timescales, these demands feed back to shape the selective landscape driving the evolution of size and diet. We develop a theoretical framework based on tri-trophic interaction motifs to explore mammalian population dynamics premised on bioenergetic tradeoffs. Our results show how interactions between predators, prey, and external subsidies generate instabilities linked to body size extrema, corresponding to observed limits of predator size and diet. These instabilities generate size-dependent constraints on coexistence and highlight a stabilizing carnivore size of 63 Kg. Finally, we show that increases in predator size confers selective advantage to dietary generalization, aligning with observations of predator diets among contemporary and Pleistocene species. Our framework underscores the importance of understanding macroevolutionary pressures through the lens of ecological interactions, where the selective forces shaping and reshaping the dynamics of communities can be explored.
